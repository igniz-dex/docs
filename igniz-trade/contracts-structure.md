# Futures Contract Structure

#### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Perpetual futures on Igniz are derivative instruments with no expiration mechanism. Price alignment with underlying spot markets is maintained through periodic funding rate settlements rather than contract rollover.

#### Collateral and Denomination Model <a href="#collateral-and-denomination-model" id="collateral-and-denomination-model"></a>

Igniz perpetual contracts utilize a USDC-collateral model with USDT-denominated pricing for optimal liquidity access and capital efficiency. Oracle price feeds are quoted in USDT, while all margin and settlement operations process in USDC.

This architecture operates as a quanto structure where profit and loss calculated in USDT terms settles in USDC without exchange rate conversion. This design eliminates conversion friction while maintaining alignment with the most liquid pricing sources across centralized and decentralized markets.

For assets where the primary liquidity source denominates in USDC, oracle pricing follows the native denomination. This applies to select platform-native tokens and assets with concentrated USDC-pair liquidity.

#### Specification Parameters <a href="#specification-parameters" id="specification-parameters"></a>

Igniz maintains streamlined contract specifications with minimal asset-specific variations and no account-level restrictions. This standardized approach simplifies trading operations across all supported instruments.
