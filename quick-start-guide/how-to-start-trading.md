# How to Start Trading

#### **Prerequisites for Trading**

Igniz operates as a fully decentralized platform with no registration or identity verification requirements. Trading access requires only a Web3-compatible wallet connection.

**Required Components:**

**EVM-Compatible Wallet**

* Compatible wallets include MetaMask, WalletConnect and OKX Wallet.
* New users can create a wallet at <https://metamask.io/>.
* After installing your preferred wallet extension, initialize a new account.
* **Critical Security Note:**&#x59;our recovery phrase grants complete access to your assets. Never share your private key or seed phrase with anyone. Store your recovery phrase in a secure physical location.

**Trading Collateral**

* Any supported token across integrated blockchain networks (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, and additional L1/L2 chains).
* Stablecoins (USDC recommended) serve as optimal trading collateral.

#### **Platform Access**

Igniz is accessible through two interfaces:

* **Web Application**- Direct browser access at app.igniz.xyz
* **Progressive Web App**- Installable PWA providing native application experience across desktop and mobile devices

#### **Wallet Connection Process**

1. Navigate to igniz.xyz and select "Connect" button.
2. Choose your wallet provider from the displayed options. Approve the connection request in your wallet extension.
3. Select "Enable Trading" to authorize signature-based order verification. This one-time signature allows gas-free order placement on the platform.
4. Your wallet is now connected and ready for trading operations.

#### **Funding Your Account**

1. Access the deposit interface through the "Deposit" button.
2. Select your preferred blockchain network and asset type.
3. Specify the deposit amount and authorize the transaction via your wallet.
4. Cross-chain settlements are handled automatically, enabling seamless trading across multiple networks.

#### **Executing Trades**

Igniz supports comprehensive order types for both spot and perpetual contracts.

**Spot Market Operations:**

1. Choose your desired trading pair from the market selector.
2. Select order type: Market, Limit, or Advanced order types.
3. Specify trade quantity.
4. Submit your order. Orders utilize cryptographic signatures, eliminating gas costs for order placement.
5. The decentralized matching engine processes your order. Trading fees apply only upon execution.

**Perpetual Contracts:**

Perpetuals enable leveraged long or short positions using USDC or supported collateral, without direct asset ownership.

1. Select your target asset from the perpetuals market.
2. Choose position direction: Long (bullish) or Short (bearish).
3. Define position size using the slider or manual input. Position size equals leverage multiplied by collateral amount.
4. Submit your order and confirm. The confirmation dialog can be disabled for subsequent trades.

#### **Asset Withdrawal Process**

1. Access the withdrawal interface through the "Withdraw" button.
2. Choose the destination blockchain network and asset type.
